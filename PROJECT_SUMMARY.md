# Azure Event Hub to ADLS Delta Pipeline - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a complete data ingestion pipeline that captures events from Azure Event Hub and stores them in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS) using Delta Tables. The pipeline is built using Apache Spark with Python and follows enterprise-grade patterns for monitoring, error handling, and scalability.

## ✅ Implementation Status

### Core Components Completed
- ✅ **Event Hub Consumer Module** - Spark Structured Streaming consumer with connection management
- ✅ **Data Processing Layer** - Schema validation, cleansing, enrichment, and error handling
- ✅ **Delta Lake Integration** - Table management, upsert operations, and partitioning
- ✅ **Monitoring & Alerting** - Structured logging, Prometheus metrics, and health checks
- ✅ **Configuration Management** - Pydantic-based settings with environment variable support
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - ARM template for Azure resource deployment
- ✅ **Testing Framework** - Unit tests and local pipeline validation
- ✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive README and deployment guide

### Testing Results
- ✅ All 7 basic functionality tests passed
- ✅ Local pipeline test completed successfully
- ✅ Sample event generation working (valid and invalid events)
- ✅ All dependencies installed and verified
- ✅ Core modules importing correctly

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Azure Event Hub → Spark Streaming → Data Processing → Delta Lake (ADLS Gen2)
                                         ↓
                                   Dead Letter Queue
                                         ↓
                                   Monitoring & Alerts
```
